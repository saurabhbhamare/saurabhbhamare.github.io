            <h2>Understanding Vectors for Game Development</h2>
            <p>Math plays a pivotal role in game development, especially when it comes to handling vectors. Let's delve into some essential concepts related to vectors that are crucial for game development.</p>

            <h3>Numbers and Their Positions</h3>
            <p>Numbers can be visualized as positions along a line, including both positive and negative values. This understanding is fundamental to grasping how vectors operate in a 2D space.</p>

            <h3>Distance Between Numbers</h3>
            <p>The distance between two numbers can be found using the absolute value of their difference: <code>abs(B - A)</code>. This ensures a non-negative result.</p>

            <h3>Understanding Vectors</h3>
            <h4>Vectors as Points in 2D Space</h4>
            <p>Vectors are pairs of numbers representing positions in a 2D coordinate system with x and y axes. These vectors can be visualized as arrows or points.</p>

            <h4>Vector Addition and Subtraction</h4>
            <p><strong>Addition:</strong> Vectors are added by summing their corresponding components.</p>
            <p><strong>Subtraction:</strong> Vector subtraction is equivalent to adding the negated version of a vector. <code>A - B</code> is described as "the vector from B to A."</p>

            <h4>Distance Between Vectors</h4>
            <p>The Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: <code>sqrt(x² + y²)</code>. The distance between two vectors is found by taking the magnitude of their difference: <code>| B - A |</code>.</p>

            <h4>Unit Vectors and Normalization</h4>
            <p><strong>Unit Vectors:</strong> These are vectors with a magnitude of 1.</p>
            <p><strong>Normalization:</strong> This process scales a vector to have a magnitude of 1, calculated by dividing the vector by its magnitude: <code>A / |A|</code>.</p>

            <h4>Dot Product</h4>
            <p>The dot product of two vectors <code>A · B</code> is defined as <code>(A.x * B.x) + (A.y * B.y)</code>. It's a single number that provides valuable information about the vectors' orientations:</p>
            <p><strong>Sign and Perpendicularity:</strong> A positive dot product means vectors point in roughly the same direction, a negative product means they are pointing opposite, and a zero dot product indicates perpendicularity.</p>
            <p><strong>Similarity:</strong> If both vectors are normalized, the dot product indicates "similarity."</p>

            <h3>Practical Game Development Examples</h3>
            <h4>Car AI</h4>
            <p><strong>Using Vectors for Car Movement and Steering:</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Position and Direction Vectors:</strong> The position of the car and the direction it's facing can be represented by vectors. The direction vector can be used to determine where the car will move next.</p>
            <p><strong>Targeting and Navigation:</strong> By calculating the vector from the car's position to a target position (e.g., a waypoint or another car), the AI can determine the direction it needs to move. This is achieved using the difference vector: <code>targetPosition - carPosition</code>.</p>
            <p><strong>Avoidance:</strong> To avoid obstacles, the AI can use vectors to calculate potential collisions and adjust the car's path. The dot product can help determine if another object is in the car's path.</p>

            <p><strong>Example Code:</strong></p>
            <pre><code>
Vector2 carPosition = new Vector2(10, 5);
Vector2 targetPosition = new Vector2(20, 15);
Vector2 direction = (targetPosition - carPosition).normalized;

// Move car towards target
carPosition += direction * speed * Time.deltaTime;

// Avoidance example
Vector2 obstaclePosition = new Vector2(15, 10);
Vector2 toObstacle = obstaclePosition - carPosition;
if (Vector2.Dot(direction, toObstacle.normalized) > 0.8f) {
    // Adjust direction to avoid obstacle
    direction = Quaternion.Euler(0, 0, 45) * direction;
}
            </code></pre>
